## 3.4 Data types
 
    the lastest ecmascript standard defines 9 types:

    - six Data Types:
      undefined
      Boolean
      String
      Number
      BigInt
      Symbol
    - 2 structural types:
      Object
      Function  typeof instance === 'function'
    - structural Root Primitive:
      null      typeof instance === 'object'


### The Undefined Type
- 1.the undefined type has only one value, which is the special value undefined. when a variable is declared using var of let but not initializedReact.Component

- 2.Only one useful operation can be performed on an undeclared variable, u can call typeof on it.


### The Null Type

> Logically, a null value is an empty object pointer, which is why `typeof` returns "object".
```js
let car = null;
console.log(typeof car); //"object"
```

> when defining a variable that is meant to later hold an object, it's advisable to initialize the variable to null as opposed to anything else. That way, u can explicity check for the value null to determine if the variable has been filled with an object reference at a later time.

```js
  if(car !== null){
    //do something with car
  }
```

> the value undefined derivative of null. so ECMA-262 defines them to be superficially equal as follows(this operator converts its operands for comparison purposes):
```js
  console.log(undefined == null); //true
  console.log(undefined === null); //false
```

### The Boolean Type

#### assignment of boolean values to variables
```js
let found = true;
let lsot = false;
```
#### the Boolean literals true and false are case-sensitive
> the True and False are valid as identifiers but not as Boolean values.

#### To convert a value to its Boolean equivalent, call the Boolean() casting function.
```js
let message = 'hello world';
let messageAsBoolean = Boolean(message);
```
#### the following table outlines the various data types and their specific conversions.

|DATA TYPE|VALUE CONVERSION TO TRUE|VALUES CONVERSION TO FALSE|
|----|---|---|
|Boolean|true|false|
|String|Any nonempty string|""(empty string)|
|Number|Any nonzero number(including infinity)|0, NaN|
|Object|Any object|null|
|Undefined|n/a|undefined|

### The Number Type
